As a proof of concept for my former employers at PBS, I made an ethnographical documentary series in the form of "Gonzo" journalism with collaboration from student creatives in the Texas A\&M filmmaking club and the Texas A\&M PBS station KAMU-FM. Some guiding ideas was an experimental, first person perspective into the various different subcultures of Texas A\&M. Early uses of my video synthesizer can be seen during the middle segment, which was a constant theme throughout the series.
