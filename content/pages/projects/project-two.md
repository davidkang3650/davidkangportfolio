For my 4th episode I joined a group of students who were among the most devoted to the school spirit of Texas A\&M. As a tradition against our rival schools and to portray the burning spirit all Aggies have, the Aggie Bonfire Crew have been building massive structures of lumber- some consisting thousands of logs and towering over a hundred feet in height- and setting them on fire since 1907. But after the unfortunate collapse of the Aggie Bonfire in 1999 which claimed 12 lives, the school is no longer allowing these fires to be built on school grounds. These were the last group of students keeping the tradition alive, completely separate from the University.
