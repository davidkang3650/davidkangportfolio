Using my video synthesizer, I focused on the immediate nature of analog signals and closed circuit cameras to conduct a set of installation pieces with audio reactive visual elements projected onto the backdrop of the performers. With microphones detecting audio from the entire set- not only the musical piece but also any sound made by people nearby- the series resulted in a highly personalized interactive performance piece for the small number of crew involved, further emphasized by the remote and desolate locations many of these took place.
