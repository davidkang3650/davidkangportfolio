      After realizing the captivating power of the moving picture and
      experiencing the visceral analog images of experimental video from video
      artists like Name June Paik, I moved to the United States from Korea to
      continue my pursuit of merging the boundary between classical and
      experimental media. I was trained with various non-linear editing
      software, and my knowledge of camera operation, framing, and composition
      comes from my time working on production sets of TV shows and movies. Many
      of my projects were produced using my analog video synthesizer setup,
      which is a custom built modular synthesizer that can play the video
      similar to how an electric keyboard plays electronic music. My creative
      focus is in the immersive, interactive, and the experimental, and I am
      collaborating with artists and musicians to create audio visual
      experiences in the vein of Allan Kaprow's Happenings.
