      Realizing the captivating power of the moving picture and experiencing the
      visceral analog images of experimental video from early video artists like
      Nam June Paik, I moved to the United States from Korea to continue my
      pursuit of blurring the boundary between classical and experimental media.
      I was trained with various non-linear editing software and my knowledge of
      camera operation, framing, and composition comes from my time working on
      production sets of TV shows and movies. Many of my projects were produced
      using my analog video synthesizer, an Eurorack modular synth that can
      "play" the video akin to how an electric keyboard plays electronic music.
      Themes I am searching for are the immersive, interactive, and
      experimental.
