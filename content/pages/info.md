      After realizing the captivating power of the moving picture and
      experiencing the visceral analog images of experimental video from video
      artists like Name June Paik, I moved to the United States from Korea to
      continue my pursuit of pushing the boundary between classical media and
      experimental media. I was trained to use various video editing software,
      and my knowledge of camera operation, framing, and composition comes from
      my time working on production sets of TV shows and movies. Many of my
      projects were produced using my analog video synthesizer, which is a
      custom built modular synthesizer that can play the video similar to how an
      electric keyboard plays electronic music. My creative focus is in the
      immersive, interactive, and the experimental, and I am collaborating with
      artists and musicians to create audio visual experiences in the vein of
      Allan Kaprow's Happenings.
